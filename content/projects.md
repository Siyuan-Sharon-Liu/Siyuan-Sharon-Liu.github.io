      title: Space and Cyberspace: The Impact of Food Delivery Platforms on Retail Real Estate
      text: This study examines how online food delivery platforms (FDPs) affect offline retailers and, as a consequence, change demand for retail real estate. FDPs are different from traditional food delivery services due their platform-owned driver networks and integrated review systems. They are also different from other online platforms in that they have a much shorter delivery distance and must maintain close interactions with physical restaurants. These attributes change the way restaurants operate and affect their location decisions. Using the staggered rollout of FDPs in each US city with a difference-in-differences design, I find that FDPs complement rather than substitute offline retailers. The entry of FDP causally increases the number of retail establishments by 1.8% and the effect comes mainly from restaurants. This increase in demand translates into the commercial real estate market: rents increase by approximately 0.9% and property prices by a similar magnitude over five years after entry. As retail property supply shows little response, landlords largely capture the surplus generated by FDP. In addition, I find that FDPs reshape the urban structure by favoring denser areas, as these places are more compatible with delivery services.
