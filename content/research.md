### Space and Cyberspace`:` The Impact of Food Delivery Platforms on Retail Real Estate
<!-- ### subtitle: Space and Cyberspace`:` The Impact of Food Delivery Platforms on Retail Real Estate -->

This study examines how online food delivery platforms (FDPs) affect offline retailers and, as a consequence, change demand for retail real estate. FDPs are different from traditional food delivery services due their platform-owned driver networks and integrated review systems. They are also different from other online platforms in that they have a much shorter delivery distance and must maintain close interactions with physical restaurants. These attributes change the way restaurants operate and affect their location decisions. Using the staggered rollout of FDPs in each US city with a difference-in-differences design, I find that FDPs complement rather than substitute offline retailers. The entry of FDP causally increases the number of retail establishments by 1.8% and the effect comes mainly from restaurants. This increase in demand translates into the commercial real estate market`:` rents increase by approximately 0.9% and property prices by a similar magnitude over five years after entry. As retail property supply shows little response, landlords largely capture the surplus generated by FDP. In addition, I find that FDPs reshape the urban structure by favoring denser areas, as these places are more compatible with delivery services.




### National Road Upgrading and Structural Transformation`:` Evidence from Ugandan Households
<!-- subtitle: Ian Herzog, Siyuan Liu, and Yue Yu -->

Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing, but a significant portion of the urban population still works in agriculture. We argue that this is because smaller cities are isolated from national markets and trade. We test this claim using individual panel data and Uganda’s doubling of paved roads, which improved remote areas’ market access. We find that market access causes workers to quit family farms for specialized paid employment outside of agriculture. Effects concentrate in peripheral areas, households with comparative advantage in off-farm work, and reflect off-farm opportunities rather than a reduced demand for farm output. We also find that market access leads remote households to simplify farming techniques and scale back farming. Findings are consistent with reliable transport enabling trade with major markets, creating opportunities to specialize according to comparative advantage.




### Ripple Effects of Deregulating Startup Investment with Entrepreneurial Spillovers
<!-- subtitle: Zijun Cheng, Siyuan Liu, and Ruichi Xiong -->

Regulatory constraints in developing countries often distort investment decisions, hindering firm entry and growth. These distortions are particularly detrimental to startups, as early-stage inefficiencies can have lasting performance effects. This paper examines a major deregulation of startup investment`:` China's 2006 Company Law reform, which significantly lowered minimum registered capital requirements for incorporation. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find the reform spurred greater firm entry in industries previously more constrained by the capital requirement. Further analysis reveals heterogeneous impacts`:` a substantial increase in firms below the old capital threshold, a sharp decrease of firms bunched at the threshold, and a modest increase above it. This pattern suggests positive spillovers from new, smaller firms to larger ones. We also find that the reform promoted greater co-location of firms across capital levels, indicating that agglomeration economies from the influx of small firms contributed to the growth of larger ones. Finally, we show the reform improved startup survival rates, particularly for firms whose initial capital choices were likely distorted by the previous regulation.
